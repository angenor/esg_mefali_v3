# Specification Quality Checklist: Extension Chrome MV3 (F24 MVP P1)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Spec scoped strictly to MVP P1 (4 user stories, 28 functional requirements). All P2/P3/P4 items explicitly listed in « Out of scope » section.
- Some technology-adjacent terms (`chrome-extension://`, `chrome.storage.session`, `Manifest V3`, regex) are necessarily mentioned in FRs because they describe the feature's runtime constraint surface, not internal architecture choices.
